# ⛽ Fuel Subsidy Management System  
📚 Software Engineering & Human-Computer Interaction Project

Welcome to the **Fuel Subsidy Management System (FSMS)** project repository.  
This is a group coursework project for **TEB2014 – Software Engineering & HCI (Sept 2025 Semester)**.

The project proposes a **nationwide fuel subsidy system** that supports real-time eligibility verification, quota management, secure transactions, and user-friendly interfaces for citizens and petrol station attendants in Malaysia.


## 🛠️ Technologies
- Python (console-based prototype)
- Microservices architecture (conceptual)
- Canva (UI wireframes & prototypes)

---

## ✨ Project Scope
This project covers:
- Requirements specification (functional & non-functional)
- System architecture and database design
- Console-based prototype for eligibility verification
- Fraud detection rule (velocity-based)
- Testing and quality assurance
- Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) design and usability evaluation

---

## 🧪 Prototype
A simple **console-based prototype** demonstrates:
- Citizen eligibility verification using MyKad
- Quota checking
- Authorization token generation

> This prototype focuses on validating system logic, not full deployment.

---

## 🎨 HCI Component
- Citizen Mobile App (Low-Fidelity Wireframes)
- POS Terminal Interface (High-Fidelity Prototype)
- Persona-based design and usability evaluation

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Deploy as a full-stack system
- Integrate real identity and payment services
- Enhance fraud detection and system scalability
